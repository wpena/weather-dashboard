# Weather Dashboard
A weather dashboard that allows a user to search for a city and retrieve weather information about the searched city, displaying the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. A 5-day forecast will also be shown, displaying the same information for 5 days in the future. The is also a search history that allows the user to click a button on a city that's been searched and display the information again.
